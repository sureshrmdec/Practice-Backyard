Q: Difference between char, varchar, nchar, nvarchar ?
A: char is fixed size datatype, so if you define char and don't use the complete
   size,it will be wasted but that's not the case with varchar which is variable size
   datatype +2 bit of storage information. nchar and nvarchar are counterpart with
   twice the size for multilangual support
