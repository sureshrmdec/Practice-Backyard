Q1: Difference between composition and inheritance
A1:

 **Always strive for highly cohesive and loosly couple Solutiont
 **Programming for interface than the implementation

 Q: List out some object oriented design principle ?
 A:
    1. Don't repeat yourself (DRY) : for a single functionality don't write code twice

    2. Encapsulate what changes - encapsualte the code that you expect/suspect
    in future Ex : Factory Design pattern (encapsulate object creation code and provide facility
    to introduce new product later with no impact on existing code)

    3. Open Closed Design principle -Classes, methods and function should be open
    for extension and closed for modification so you don't change already tried and tested code

    4. Single Responsibilty Principle - A class should handle only one functionality ane md do it well
    because if your class handles more than one , there may be chances ,that updating once code will
    break other function code

    5.Dependency Injection or Inversion principle

Q: Tell me about Factory Design pattern
A: (You know you have to create a object, but don't know in advance what kind of object)
   It's a creational design pattern based on the idea of encapsulation. It will encapsulate
   object creation

   Ex: Whenever we create object using new ,we somehow hard coded the object instantation.
   Ex: When a class contain object from other class ,you create other class object using new
   and this creates dependency between two classes.
